## Genetic Algorithms 

To understand genetic algorithms better, I implemented solutions using genetic algorithms for Knapsack and traveling salesman problem. To properly implement genetic algorithms, we need to apply natural selection or selective breeding principles to our program. Genetic algorithms are being used in AI and can provide very efficient solutions to NP-Hard problems. 

In this project, I tried to apply selective breeding principle to my program. This search heuristic basically tries to provide the best genes (combinations) for our problems. I implemented different genetic algorithm classes for each problem. 

- Selection rules, mutation rates and breeding cycles can be changed.  
- Moreover, you can observe the analysis of these solutions in test scripts.
